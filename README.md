# Environment Authoring Kit (Unity)

**Not a one-click finished world — a strong procedural base framework you can build on.**

Environment Authoring Kit gives you a fast, **AI-assisted foundation** for Unity: procedural land layout, cave structure, and core world scaffolding. You still shape, refine, and detail the final world.

This repository is the **shareable Unity project + UPM package** (`com.cursor.environment-authoring-kit`). It does **not** include third-party Asset Store props, store cave meshes, sample scenes, or the VITURE native SDK — those stay on your machine under separate licenses.

**Accuracy contract:** [docs/PUBLIC_REPO_SCOPE.md](docs/PUBLIC_REPO_SCOPE.md) — what is on GitHub vs local-only (read before trusting other docs).

**Package version:** **0.3.0** · queued cave build: **120/120** steps.

## What is on GitHub (honest scope)

| Included | Not included (bring your own) |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| `Packages/com.cursor.environment-authoring-kit/` — editor pipeline, grading, Hub, optional Cursor/LLM grader | Asset Store / marketplace folders under `Assets/` (city packs, lava-tube meshes, characters, etc.) |
| `Assets/EnvironmentKit/` — presets, recipes, kit docs | Unity scenes (`.unity`) — create or copy locally |
| `ProjectSettings/`, `Packages/manifest.json` — Unity 6 + URP + **OpenXR / XR Interaction Toolkit** deps | `Assets/EnvironmentKit/Generated/` — build output (gitignored) |
| Root docs: `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `docs/`, `.github/workflows/` | `.env` API keys, `node_modules/`, VITURE/GlassesGateway native binaries |

After clone, open the folder in **Unity Hub** (see [Requirements](#requirements)).

---

## Required before your first build (read this after clone)

**A fresh clone is not playable until you add the items below.** The kit runs a **preflight checklist** before **Build Complete Cave Level**. If anything required is missing, the build stops immediately with:

`Automated FullWorld blocked (N issue(s)). See Assets/EnvironmentKit/Generated/CaveBuildPreflightReport.md`

That is **expected** — open the report and fix every row marked **BLOCK**.

### Checklist (all required for FullWorld)

| # | You must provide | Why |
|---|------------------|-----|
| 1 | **Unity scene** with a walkable surface tagged **`Ground`** | Preflight: *Ground tag / anchor* |
| 2 | GameObject **`PortalFive`** (cave entrance anchor) | Cave mouth placement |
| 3 | **3D mesh prefabs** somewhere under `Assets/` (auto-discovered; modular cave/dungeon/rock packs) | Preflight: *Environment module prefab catalog* — **not** 2D sprites or texture-only folders |
| 4 | **Node 18+** and **`npm install`** in `Packages/com.cursor.environment-authoring-kit/Tools/cave-grader` | Preflight: *Node + tsx* — automated FullWorld expects the grader tools installed |

### Prefabs (automatic discovery)

On every preflight/build, the kit **scans all of `Assets/`** for 3D prefabs with meshes and classifies them into floor / wall / ceiling (by name, path, and mesh shape). Hub prefab folder fields are **optional** — use them only to limit or prioritize folders.

**Will not work as cave modules:** texture-only packs (PNG materials with no prefabs), 2D tilemap sprite packs, UI prefabs.

Import licensed **3D modular** content into `Assets/`, then **Save Hub Settings** or run preflight. Materials under discovered packs are upgraded to URP when possible.

Leave **Hub project root** empty so reports and `npm` paths resolve to **this** Unity project (not another folder on your machine).

### After setup

1. **Window → Environment Kit → Hub** → run build, or use **Cave Build → Diagnostics → View Preflight Report** to confirm all **PASS** (warnings are OK).
2. Optional: **Cave Build → Diagnostics → Apply Reliable FullWorld Preset** (recommended settings for first full run).

**Not in git (optional, speeds up research):** `Assets/EnvironmentKit/ResearchCache/` — run `npm run sync-research-pull` in `Tools/cave-grader` when you want Florida research data locally.

## XR / glasses — what is real vs what is not

### What the kit actually does for XR

- Applies an **`XROptimizationProfile`** during full builds (default preset: `Assets/EnvironmentKit/Presets/VitureXRPro.asset`) — LOD, colliders, URP hints tuned for **mobile / stereoscopic** budgets.
- Project manifest includes **Unity XR Management**, **OpenXR**, **Android XR OpenXR**, and **XR Interaction Toolkit** — you can target head-mounted displays through Unity’s normal XR plug-in setup.
- Optional **`VitureIntegration`** — if a VITURE-named assembly is already in *your* project, the kit logs and skips hard failures; it does **not** ship the VITURE SDK.

### What this repo is **not**

- **Not “plug in glasses and play”** out of the box — no demo scene, no device QA, no VITURE neckband SDK in git.
- **Not a substitute** for VITURE/OpenXR project settings, Android build targets, or your hardware vendor documentation.
- **Not claiming** commercial ship quality on device until **you** grade, profile, and playtest on hardware.

**Short answer:** XR is **supported in the authoring pipeline and dependencies**, not **finished glasses-ready product** in this public repo.

## Quick start (after clone)

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Unity Hub → **Unity 6000.4.6f1** (or 6000.x matching `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`) → open this repo root |
| 2 | Let Package Manager resolve URP/XR packages (first open may take a few minutes) |
| 3 | Complete the **[Required before your first build](#required-before-your-first-build-read-this-after-clone)** checklist (scene, Ground, PortalFive, prefabs, `npm install`) |
| 4 | **Window → Environment Kit → Hub** → confirm preflight passes (or read `CaveBuildPreflightReport.md`) |
| 5 | Run **Build Complete Cave Level (Active Scene)** |
| 6 | Watch **Cave Build → Diagnostics → Pipeline Console** through **120/120** queued steps |
| 7 | Optional: **Cave Build Grader** + Cursor/LLM automation ([package docs](Packages/com.cursor.environment-authoring-kit/docs/CaveGradingAndCursor.md)) — needs `.env` API keys |

If a prior run left only a ramp/mouth with no tunnels: **Cave Build → Advanced → Build Complete Cave — Full AAA Rebuild (invalidate ladder)**.

**Secrets:** copy `Tools/cave-grader/.env.example` → `.env` locally; never commit API keys.
